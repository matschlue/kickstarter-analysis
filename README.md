# An analysis for kickstarter campaigns
## Performance of an analysis with kickstarter data to uncover trends
For this examination kickerstarter data was used to determine and expose trends regarding two relationships:

- Launch date vs outcome (successful, failed, cancelled)
- Funding goal vs outcome (successful, failed)

This data set was then analyzed via the creation of additional rows (e.g. Year), Pivot tables as well as graphic visualizations. A possible challenge to this analysis could be the applcation of the right filters and formulas to arrive to correct conclusions. 

## Results
### Launch date vs outcome

The most successful launch date according to the data is during _May_. In total, there were approximately 110 successful launches in the theater category, which is substantially higher than in any other month. 

The worst point in time to launch a campaign is _December_. The data reveals that the amount of successful launches and failed launches are essentially the same during that period of time. A possible reason for this discovery might be that there is less available excess cash due to Christmas purchases.
