# An analysis for kickstarter campaigns
## Performance of an analysis with kickstarter data to uncover trends
For this examination kickerstarter data was used to determine and expose trends regarding two relationships:

- Launch date vs outcome (successful, failed, cancelled)
- Funding goal vs outcome (successful, failed)


## Results
### Launch date vs outcome

The most successful launch date according to the data is during _May_. In total, there were approximately 110 successful launches in the theater category, which is substantially higher than in any other month. 

The worst point in time to launch a campaign is _December_. The data reveals that the amount of successful launches and failed launches are essentially the same during that period of time. A possible reason for this discovery might be that there is less available excess cash due to Christmas purchases.  


### Outcomes vs goals

Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
## What are some limitations of this dataset?
## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
